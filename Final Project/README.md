<h2>This is the final project of the course Machine Learning with Python</h2> 
<h2> The Best Classifier</h2>
<br>
In this project, I have completed a notebook where I have built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.<br>

I have a historical dataset from previous loan applications, I have cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data. I have used following algorithms to build the model:<br>

k-Nearest Neighbour<br>
Decision Tree<br>
Support Vector Machine<br>
Logistic Regression<br>
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:<br>

Jaccard index<br>
F1-score<br>
LogLoass<br>
